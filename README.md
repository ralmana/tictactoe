# Reflection of the Prcoess of this Project!

### 1. Identify one problem you encountered in this unit (i.e., during the independent project, not before) and describe how you overcame it. This might be fixing a bug, implementing a feature, or understanding a new concept or skill. Include a code snippet along with your explanation.

One problem I encountered was making the restart button and status/ round indicater on the same line under the gameboard. I overcame this by playing around with the margin spaces of the status and restart button. 

### 2. How has your understanding of computing changed since the beginning of the semester? Identify at least one specific piece of knowledge, concept, or attitude.

My knowledge in Computing increased since Janurary because I have developed and increased my knowledge by practicing through many programs, such as Code HS, w3schools, and Harvard CS50. I used to think that coding was only a bunch of 0's and 1's, and now I know its more than just that and there are different types of languages.
  
### 3. What new skills have you acquired this semester? Identify at least one thing you can do now that you could not do before taking the class.

Skills I have acquired were creating webpages, creating interactive webpages (using Java Script, HTML, and CSS), annd developing programs in CS50.

### 4. In what ways do computers improve our lives? Explain.

Computers improve our lives in many different ways. Computers give us access to the internet, and they entertain us with games, videos, and films. Computers also connect us with the world and to loved ones with cellular enabled computers.
  
### 5. In what ways would our lives be improved by removing computers from our lives? Explain

One way our lives would be improved if we removed computers from our lives is we would have better sleep and wouldnt be up at night on our mobile devices, our eyes would be healthier, and we would have better posture, because when you are on your phone, you usually bend your neck, which is bad for you. Our lives would also improve because we would spend more time with the people around us, not be as worries as much about global events, and cyber racism/bullying would vanish.

### 6. Will being in this class have an impact on you in the future? In what way?
   
Possibly, because technology is developing everyday, and knowing the basics of some of the main coding languages is good, so I can also understand how technology works. I also might be taking an AP Computer Science in my Junior or Senior year, so having knowledge about computer science prior to then would be an advantage for me.
